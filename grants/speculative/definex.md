## Project Description
Definex is a Financial market protocol that provides both liquid money markets for cross-chain assets and peer-to-peer capital markets for longer-term cryptocurrencies loans.

 In which we will build two run-time modules that respectively:
* Automatically adjust the interest rates based on the amount saved and the amount borrowed  + * A p2p lending module that can be used for longer maturity fixed assets
